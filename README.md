# [WebService Mock](https://github.com/Chaks/webservice-mock)
**WebService Mock** is a very simple yet powerful tool for mocking WebServices.

## Why WebService Mock?

* Mocking is achieved in a non intrusive way, without writing even a single line of code, which means no need to mock the service stubs.
* Can be used for stress or load testing the applications without hitting the actual WebServices. Your service providers may not agree always.
* You want to simulate different test scenarios or conditions without engaging/involving your service providers.

## Getting started
